  // In Java, the synchronized keyword is used to achieve thread synchronization,
  // which ensures that only one thread can access a particular block of code
  // or an object at a time. It's important to note that the synchronized keyword
  //can impact performance, as it introduces thread contention and may cause threads
  // to wait for the lock to be released.
  // if your logging operations involve shared mutable state or if you want to ensure that
  // only one thread at a time performs the logging operations, you may choose
  // to use synchronized or other synchronization mechanisms to ensure thread safety.
